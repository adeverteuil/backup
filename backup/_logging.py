"""Logging configuration.

This module configures two logging handlers:

    1.  A stream handler that writes to stdout and stderr;
    2.  A memory handler that memorizes output for deferred writing to a
        log file who's path is known at runtime.

The following class is defined:
    Logging
        Subclass for any class that could use a _logger attribute.

There are also the following module level functions:
    add_file_handler():
        This function is called when the destination directory is known,
        which happens after parsing the configuration file and command
        line arguments.
    move_file_handler(dest):
        This function is called when a backup is completed and the log file
        can be added to the snapshot's directory.
