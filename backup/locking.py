"""This module provides locking facilities.

The Lockable class may be inherited by classes that must implement a
locking mechanism over shared resources.

Exceptions:

    Error -- base class for other exceptions
        LockError -- base class for all locking exceptions
            AlreadyLocked -- Another object, thread or process already holds
                             the lock
            LockFailed -- Lock failed for some other reason
        UnlockError -- base class for all unlocking exceptions
            AlreadyUnlocked -- File was not locked.
            NotMyLock -- File was locked but not by the current thread/process

Some code was taken from <https://github.com/smontanaro/pylockfile>.
Gratitude is owed to smontanaro.
