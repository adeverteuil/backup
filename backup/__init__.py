    online hosts unreachable, such as a wrong hostname or IP address, a
    missing ssh-agent identity, or the public key is not copied over to

    This exception is raise on two occasions:
    1.  PipeLogger counts the number of bytes transferred in real

        is checked by Cycle, which in turn raises FlaggedSnapshotError.
